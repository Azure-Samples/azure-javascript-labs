## Use Azure Functions to build a RESTful API

Create an Azure Functions serverless API that returns a list of pets to be adopted. In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic REST API using Node.js Azure Functions and add dependencies from npm.

[Go to lab](1-vscode-serverless/README.md)

## Windows for Node.js Developers

Setup and customize a Windows PC for Open Source development using the Windows Terminal and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). At the end of this lab you'll use VS Code to debug a Node.js project running in WSL.

<!-- ## Deploying a Node.js app with GitHub Actions

Create a web app in the Azure Cloud using the App Service extension in VS Code then configure a GitHub Actions workflow to add CI/CD to your app and get it deployed. In this lab you'll learn how to build, test, and deploy your app to Azure from your GitHub repository.

[Go to lab](3-github-actions) -->

## Use Visual Studio Online

Use Visual Studio Online to build, run, and debug a Node.js app from within a browser. In this lab, you'll learn how to create a VS Online environment from an existing GitHub repository and forward a port for local debugging.
